Today I got to know about an open source mind-mapping tool for creating structured diagrams, Its name is FreeMind. It is written in Java.

One interesting thing about Freemind is that Its documentation is itself available as a FreeMind mind map.

You can access its documentation from application menu:
<pre>Application menu:<code>Help &gt; Documentation</code></pre>
&nbsp;

You can easily download Freemind software from terminal on Linux OS by following these simple steps

Please make sure you have Java 8 installed on your system.
<pre>sudo mkdir /usr/bin/freemind
sudo unzip Downloads/freemind-bin-max-1.0.1.zip -d /usr/bin/freemind/
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/freemind/freemind.sh

Now test this: 
cd /usr/bin/freemind/
./freemind.sh

</pre>
Now, make it convenient (the easy way): Create a desktop launch for unity.
While Freemind is still running:
Right-click on the Freemind icon in the unity launcher &gt; Lock to Launcher.4

It is used to create diagrams of relationships between concepts, ideas, or other pieces of information. It gives you the flexibility to organise thoughts on a page as they connect to each other and to the larger picture. After all, not all minds reason in subheadings and bullet points. You shape, place, and name that master idea (the root node), then create child or sibling spokes that relate to it.

Happy Mind Mapping!
