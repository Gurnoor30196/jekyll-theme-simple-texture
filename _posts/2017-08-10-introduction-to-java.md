<b>Java</b> is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based,  object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">recompilation.Java</span>applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the mostly used in particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems’ Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ programming language.

The Java language was designed with the following properties:

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Platform independent</strong>: Java programs use the Java virtual machine as abstraction and do not access the operating system directly. This makes Java programs highly portable. A Java program (which is standard-compliant and follows certain rules) can run unmodified on all supported platforms, e.g., Windows or Linux.</li>
 	<li><strong>Object-orientated programming language</strong>: Except the primitive data types, all elements in Java are objects.</li>
 	<li><strong>Strongly-typed programming language:</strong> Java is strongly-typed, e.g., the types of the used variables must be pre-defined and conversion to other objects is relatively strict, e.g., must be done in most cases by the programmer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Interpreted and compiled language:</strong> Java source code is transferred into the bytecode format which does not depend on the target platform. These bytecode instructions will be interpreted by the Java Virtual machine (JVM). The JVM contains a so-called Hotspot-Compiler which translates performance critical bytecode instructions into native code instructions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Automatic memory management:</strong> Java manages the memory allocation and de-allocation for creating new objects. The program does not have direct access to the memory. The so-called garbage collector automatically deletes objects to which no active pointer exists.</li>
 	<li><b>Robust</b> − Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</li>
 	<li><b>Multithreaded</b> − With Java’s multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</li>
 	<li><b>High Performance</b> − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.</li>
</ul>
