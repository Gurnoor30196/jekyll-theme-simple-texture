Being a Github user the only thing that has bothered me about the process is that every time I want to deploy a new version of my website whose code is on Github is, I have to push it to GitHub and then SSH into the server and manually do aÂ <code>git clone</code>

What I really wanted was a way to just push the commits to GitHub and<strong> then have the server automatically pull the updates.</strong>

So after some web surfing, I got to know about <strong>Webhook</strong>.

Webhooks provide a way for notifications to be delivered to an external web server whenever certain actions occur in a repository or organization.

Webhooks can be triggered whenever a variety of actions are performed on a repository or an organization. For example, you can configure a web hook to execute whenever:
<ul>
	<li>A repository is pushed to</li>
	<li>A pull request is opened</li>
	<li>A GitHub Pages site is built</li>
	<li>A new member is added to a team</li>
</ul>
Till now I am not as such got succeeded in achieving my goal to do this on my project because I am getting an unexpected error, but I will do that on my project very soon because I know I landed at the right place(webhooks) and also will share that in my future blog.
