Today I learned to collaborate code on Github. Earlier I only knew how to push a project on Git and that also I always use to google the 4-5 basic commands require to push a project with default configurations. I used to get stuck If I got an error while pushing a project like
<pre>! [rejected] master -&gt; master (fetch first) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Gurnoor30196/Anyprojectxxx.git' hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.</pre>
because I did not know the meaning of those commands. I always use to just copy paste those commands, So I decided to learn the meaning of each and every command that I use (This should be implemented in every case). I learned to fork&nbsp;a project, creating a pull request, creating new branches, editing default configurations etc.

I decided to practically&nbsp;implement everything which I have learnt today, So I pushed a project and asked my friend Abhinav who was also working on the same project to fork my project and merge his contribution and then send me a pull request.

After reaching home I realised that my daily progress is not up to the mark, in fact&nbsp;very less as compared to my desired&nbsp;level. I realised that if I do not split my goal into small tasks then I will achieve nothing because days are passing very quickly and I have to manage my time accordingly. So I decided to split by goal into small tasks&nbsp;which I have to perform&nbsp;daily with a deadline.

Today I solved a data structure question with Python&nbsp;and same with java to improve my programming skills. I decided to learn few new English words daily and then try to implement them into my future blogs thereby improving my vocabulary.<em><strong></strong></em>
