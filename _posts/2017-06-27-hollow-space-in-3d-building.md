Yesterday, I learned to create hollow space in a 3D building. For that, you first need to login to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> website and then select a building of your interest having hollow space.
<ul>
 	<li>Click on "Edit" which is located at the upper left corner of the website.</li>
 	<li>Click on "area" and then mark the area of building</li>
 	<li>Then select feature type as Building Features &gt; Building.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Fill the necessary details in the fields section and also under tags section like elevation, levels etc.</li>
 	<li>Under all relation click on "new relation" and then select "Multipolygon"</li>
 	<li>Under tag section select Building as Yes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Now you have member section in your features list of Multipolygon.</li>
 	<li>Under member section click on Building</li>
 	<li>Now your Building features list will prompt.</li>
 	<li>Under All relations &gt; Multipolygon, type Outer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Now you have to outline the Hollow section with "Line".</li>
 	<li>After outlining select it as Line.</li>
 	<li>After selecting it as line new features list window will prompt.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Under All relation section, click "+" and then select Multipolygon, type role as inner.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Save it .</li>
 	<li>After around 10 mins you will see your hollow building as 3D on <a href="http://tiny.gdy.club/a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">osmbuildings website </a></li>
</ul>
