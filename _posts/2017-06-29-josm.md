Today I explored JOSM which is Java Open Street Map Editor and I also read some articles related to indoor mapping. I learned how one can increase its efficiency with the help of JOSM for editing buildings, which further can be used to build 3D maps with the help of suitable Javascript library like osmbuildings. I build a water tank with the help of JOSM which you can see in <a href="https://osmbuildings.org/?lat=30.85679&amp;lon=75.85942&amp;zoom=17.4&amp;rotation=0&amp;tilt=30">this</a> link.
