Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an
emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was
initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and
has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientserver sys-
tems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux
kernel, Git is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License version 2 to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses
SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branch-
ing, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

<strong>Installation of Git</strong>
Installation of git is a very easy process. The current git version is: 2.0.4. Type the commands
in the terminal:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git

This will install the git on your pc or laptop.
