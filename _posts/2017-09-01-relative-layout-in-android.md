<div class="paragraph">

<code>RelativeLayout</code> allows positioning the widget relative to each other. This can be used for complex layouts. RelativeLayout is a complex layout manager and should only be used if such a complex layout is required, as it performs a resource intensive calculation to layout its children.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">

A simple usage for <code>RelativeLayout</code> is if you want to center a single component. Just add one component to the <code>RelativeLayout</code> and set the <code>android:layout_centerInParent</code> attribute to true.

</div>
