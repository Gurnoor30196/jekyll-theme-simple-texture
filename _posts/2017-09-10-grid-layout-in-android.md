<code>GridLayout</code> was introduced with Android 4.0. This layout allows you to organize a view into a Grid. GridLayout separates its drawing area into: rows, columns, and cells.

<div class="paragraph">

You can specify how many columns you want to define for each <code>View</code>, in which row and column it should be placed as well as how many columns and rows it should use. If not specified,<code>GridLayout</code> uses defaults, e.g., one column, one row and the position of a view depends on the order of the declaration
